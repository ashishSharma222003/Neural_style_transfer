Potential improvements:

-Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimenting with different values for hyperparameters such as learning rate, alpha, and beta can improve the quality of the generated image. Adjust these values to achieve better results.

-Image Size: The code is configured to work with images of size 400x400 pixels. You can modify the img_size variable to work with larger or smaller images based on your requirements. Note that larger images may require more computational resources and training time.

-Training Duration: The number of training epochs is set to 20,001. You can adjust this value based on the convergence of the style transfer process. Additionally, you can consider implementing early stopping techniques to stop training when the improvement in the generated image becomes negligible.

-Multiple Style Images: The code currently supports a single style image. To incorporate multiple style images, you can compute the style cost for each style image separately and then combine them using appropriate weights.

Limitations:

-Computational Resources: Neural Style Transfer, especially when using large neural networks like VGG-19, can be computationally intensive. It may require a powerful machine or access to GPU resources for faster training.

-Time Complexity: Generating high-quality stylized images can take substantial time, especially when using a large number of training epochs. The time required for training increases with the complexity of the style image and the content image.

-Loss Function Limitations: The content loss and style loss used in this code are not the only ways to measure content and style similarity. There are alternative approaches and loss functions that can be explored to achieve different artistic effects.

-Limited Style Transfer Control: The current implementation does not provide fine-grained control over the style transfer process. While Style_Layers and the corresponding weights can be adjusted, further customization options may be limited in this code snippet.
